It can have any number of arguments but must consist of a single expression. The result of the expression is implicitly returned\n","\n","9.Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n","  - The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item in an iterable (eg list, tuple) and returns a map object (an iterator) containing the results. It is commonly used for transforming data in a concise and functional way\n","  function: A function that defines the operation to perform on each element of the iterable(s).\n","  iterable: One or more iterables whose elements the function is applied to\n","\n","10.What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","   - The map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python are higher-order functions used for functional programming\n","   1. Purpose\n","   map(): Transforms each element in an iterable by applying a function to it.\n","   filter(): Filters elements of an iterable based on a condition specified by a function, keeping only the elements for which the function returns True.\n","   reduce(): Reduces an iterable to a single cumulative value by repeatedly applying a function to pairs of elements.\n","   2. Return Type\n","   map(): Returns a map object (iterator) of transformed elements.\n","   filter(): Returns a filter object (iterator) containing only elements that meet the condition.\n","   reduce(): Returns a single value (not an iterable).\n","   3. Input and Function Behavior\n","   map(): Applies the function to all elements and always returns a result for each element.\n","   filter(): Selects only the elements that satisfy the condition; others are discarded.\n","   reduce(): Combines elements cumulatively, reducing the data to a single result.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"s26hPBb3wAyW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Theory Question"],"metadata":{"id":"SAqaEoAOzT3J"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\"\"\"1.
